## Problem Description
The aim of the project was to create reports that would help in analyzing data related to crimes committed in Los Angeles. The goal of the project was to gain knowledge about the most common types of crimes, their characteristics, as well as data on victims and perpetrators.

## Data
The data used in the project was obtained from the official website of the Los Angeles Police Department. It contains information about crimes committed between 2019 and 2022. The data includes information about the types of crimes, their dates and locations, as well as the race, gender, and age of the victims, and information about arrests and suspects.

## Data Processing
Python language and Jupyter Notebook tool were used for data processing. The data was pre-processed by removing unnecessary columns and rows, processing crime times into a more convenient format, and changing codes to ethnic names of victims.

#### This process can be seen step by step in the LA Crime.ipynb file.

## Data Analysis
Several visualizations and reports were conducted in the Power BI tool as part of the data analysis.

The "Los Angeles Crime Report" dashboard contains reports and visualizations on crime and crime victims in different districts of Los Angeles. This dashboard includes a slicer that allows the user to select the district of interest and see which crimes are most commonly committed there. Additionally, the dashboard includes a crime heatmap, a pie chart showing the race of the victims, and a chart displaying the age distribution by gender of the victims.

The "LA Crime Rates by Weekday and Hour" dashboard presents reports and visualizations related to the time of day and locations of crimes in Los Angeles. This panel includes reports on the hours and days of the week when crimes are most commonly committed. Additionally, this dashboard includes a table of crime locations such as streets or single-family homes, along with the number of cases and the percentage breakdown by gender of the victims.


## Summary

The project of analyzing crime data in Los Angeles allowed us to gain knowledge about the most common types of crimes, the times and days of the week when crimes are most commonly committed, and the locations of crime. The results of the analysis can be used to make decisions regarding crime prevention or police action planning.
